Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.


If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

If the current middleware ends the request-response cycle it should not call next() as there is no request to be handled 

Middlewares execute in the order they are placed like normal js programming and the request goes to every middleware untill the request response cycle ends


If no middleware ends the req-res cylcle the request is sent to route handlers




Middleware is incredibly versatile and is used for:

Request/Response Manipulation

Authentication

Logging

Error Handling

Data Parsing

Static File Serving

Rate Limiting

CORS

Validation

Session Management

Compression

Custom Logic

It allows you to modularize your application's logic and keep your route handlers clean and focused.




ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion: Which One to Use?
Use Case	Middleware to Use
API receiving JSON data (React, Angular, Postman, etc.)	express.json()
HTML form submission (without JavaScript)	express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
Complex form data with nested objects	express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
Handling both JSON and form data	Use both: express.json() and express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
ðŸ”¹ If your app needs to support both JSON and form submissions, you can use both middlewares together:

js
Copy
