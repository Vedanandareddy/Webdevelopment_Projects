âœ… children is a special prop in layout.js that receives the content of the current page (page.js).
âœ… The Navbar and Footer remain the same across all pages, but {children} dynamically changes based on the page.
âœ… This approach ensures consistent layouts while allowing each page to have unique content.

ðŸš€ Why Use layout.js in Next.js?
âœ” Avoids duplicate code (No need to add Navbar/Footer in every page).
âœ” Consistent UI across all pages.
âœ” Better performance (Layout doesn't re-render on page navigation).
