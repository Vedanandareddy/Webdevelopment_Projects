for Image tag it is mandatory to set width and height 

üìå Fixing "Invalid src prop" Error in Next.js (next/image)
‚ö† Why does this error occur?
Next.js optimizes images using the <Image> component, but for security reasons, external images from unknown domains are blocked unless explicitly allowed in next.config.js.

Since media.istockphoto.com is not configured, Next.js throws this error.



 Add Allowed Image Domains in next.config.js
You need to update next.config.js to include media.istockphoto.com in the images.domains array.

üõ† Steps to Fix:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Open next.config.js (or next.config.mjs).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the file as follows:

javascript
Copy
Edit
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    domains: ["media.istockphoto.com"],  // Allow external images from this domain
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
3Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the development server for changes to take effect:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm run dev




üõ† Why object-fit is Not Working in Your Next.js <Image> Component
The issue is that Next.js <Image> does not directly support object-fit unless fill is used.
Since you are using width={500} height={300}, the image size is fixed, so object-fit does not apply properly.


‚úÖ Fix Explanation:

fill={true} makes the image cover the entire parent div.
relative on parent div is required because fill makes the <Image> absolutely positioned.
object-cover ensures cropping instead of distortion.



üéØ TL;DR
‚úÖ Use fill={true} with relative parent for full coverage.
‚úÖ If using width & height, apply objectFit inside style.
‚ùå object-fit won‚Äôt work correctly on <Image> unless fill is used.
