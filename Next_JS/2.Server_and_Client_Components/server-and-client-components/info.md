1️⃣ Server Components (default)
Rendered on the server before sending HTML to the browser.
Do not include JavaScript in the client, reducing bundle size.
Ideal for fetching data, rendering static content, and optimizing performance.


Use Cases for Server Components
✅ Fetching and rendering data from a database or API.
✅ Rendering static content that doesn’t need interactivity.
✅ Keeping secrets secure (e.g., database queries).



🚀 Why?
This fetches data on the server and sends ready-to-render HTML to the browser.
Reduces JavaScript sent to the client.





2️⃣ Client Components ("use client")
Rendered on the client (browser) after the page loads.
Required for interactivity (state, event handlers, hooks).
Larger bundle size compared to server components.


Use Cases for Client Components
✅ Interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals).
✅ Using React hooks like useState or useEffect.
✅ Handling real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets).


🚀 Why?
Uses useState, which requires client-side JavaScript.
Updates dynamically without a full page reload.





3️⃣ Combining Server & Client Components
You can mix both in a Next.js app.
For example, a Server Component fetches product data, while a Client Component adds interactivity.


🔹 ProductPage is server-rendered (fetching data on the server).
🔹 Counter is a client component (handling user interaction).



🔑 Key Takeaways

Feature	        Server Components	                Client Components
Rendering	    Server-side	Client-side
Interactivity	❌ No interactivity	                ✅ Supports interactivity
State & Hooks	❌ Cannot use useState, useEffect	✅ Supports hooks
Performance	    ✅ Faster, smaller bundles	         ❌ Larger bundle size
