Next Js is a framework used on top of react to make things simple and easy to work with 

Next Js uses file based routing where we app is the main page and files inside are treated as routes and the content is placed in page.js

/about is created by making and about folder and writing the content in page.js in that folder , easy for nested routing 

title of the page can be set by changing the title in layout.js in app folder 


 "@/components/Navbar";
 @ specifies that outermost folder instead of ../ notations 
 Difference Between ./ and ../
./ (Current Directory)

Refers to the same directory as the current file.
Used when importing a file from the same folder.
../ (Parent Directory)

Moves one level up in the directory structure.
Used when importing a file from a higher-level folder.



placing a component in layout shows that component in all pages
