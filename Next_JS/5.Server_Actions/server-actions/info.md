Server Actions used for-:

Security and Performance:
Server Actions ensure that sensitive operations (like payments, database updates, or content moderation) run exclusively on the server, reducing security risks and network overhead.

Simplified Development:
By eliminating the need for separate API routes for many use cases, you reduce boilerplate code and streamline the development process, which is especially beneficial in large-scale applications.

Real-World Examples:

E-Commerce Platforms: Large e-commerce sites using Next.js can use Server Actions for secure order processing and payment integration.
Media and Publishing: Content platforms or blogs can simplify comment handling and content updates by embedding Server Actions in their components.
SaaS Dashboards: Software-as-a-Service products often need to perform complex server-side operations (like data aggregation or user management) which are well-suited for Server Actions.

âœ… Yes, but it's not always necessary.

By default, <button> inside a form submits it.
Explicitly using type="submit" is best practice to avoid ambiguity.
Use type="button" to prevent submission if the button is for UI actions only.
