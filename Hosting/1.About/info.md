After creating a website we want to be accesed by users in their devices 
for this we need to maintain server that runs all the time and responds to the requests on the server according to the code written 
This cant be achieved in our own computer as this needs continuous working 
Thats why we use hosting platforms to rent a computer in their setup and make our website available to users 24x7

When you host a website using a hosting platform you are given a ip adress , username , password this can be used to acess the terminal of the virtual computer you are given for hosting 

these computers are up all the time and we are renting these computers for hosting our website 
We can buy servers in vaious countries provided by the hosting companies so that our webiste is accesed faster in those areas 

We are given control of linux terminal of the computer through which we can manage the hosing of our website 

for uploading multiple files to the virtual computer we can use filezilla to share this files by dragging and dropping them 

we can connect to the virtual computer using 
SSH root@ip
password 

in filezilla files shared on port 22

ssh root@{ipadress} 
here root is the username used for connecting to virtual computer ,for accesing linux terminal


Three Types of hosting 
1.Shared Hosting      single computer resources are shared by multiple users
2.Dedicated hosting   dedicated for single user 
3.Managed Hosting     easy to manage dashboard for better user experience

An Apache web server is primarily used to deliver website content by processing HTTP requests from users and sending them the requested web pages or files, essentially acting as the intermediary between a user's browser and the website they are trying to access; it is one of the most popular web servers on the internet, known for its reliability and security.
