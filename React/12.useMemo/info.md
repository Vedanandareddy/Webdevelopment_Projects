Can useEffect replace useMemo?
In some cases, useEffect can update a state that stores a memoized value, but it’s not as efficient as using useMemo for simple computations. If you're dealing with values that don't need side effects (like fetching data), useMemo is usually the better choice for memoization, while useEffect should be reserved for tasks that cause side effects (like data fetching, setting up event listeners, etc.).

In summary:

If you want to avoid unnecessary recalculations of a value based on dependencies, use useMemo.
If you want to perform an action (side effect) when dependencies change, use useEffect.
Thus, useEffect doesn't replace useMemo and vice versa—they are suited for different use cases.
